            trNgGrid is a feature rich declarative data grid based on the popular AngularJs framework
            and making use of plain table HTML elements.

                                Simply because everything else you're gonna find out there is either:
                            </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>breaking the separation of concerns, forcing you to initialize it inside a controller, and not inside the view</li>
                                    <li>using DIVs instead of the elements meant to display tabular data, hence performing poorly and, as a bonus,  turning the rendered markup into spaghetti</li>
                                    <li>over-engineered without giving you much in return, making it just difficult to maintain</li>
                                    <li>quite pricey</li>
                                    <li>bringing along bloated old dependencies for the ride</li>
                                </ul>

                                <li>spits out plain HTML table elements, meant to be used for displaying tabular data, thus helping the browsers to optimize the rendering</li>
                                <li>allows you to fully describe it in a view, without messing up your controllers with elaborate configs</li>
                                <li>fully customizable via templates and two-way data bound attributes</li>
                                <li>easy to maintain, as its code was written in TypeScript. The repository also has the JS implementation, so no need to worry if you don't want to learn a new technology (even though I strongly recommend this one)</li>
                                <li>has a very short list of dependencies: Angular and Bootstrap CSS</li>
                                <li>it's far from perfection, but it's actively being maintained and improved</li>

                            Not everything is sweet and wonderful though. There are a few limitations which you should be aware of before jumping in.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Multiple `TR` rows in the table definition are not supported. In other words, you can't have more than one row per header, footer, or per data item.</li>
                                <li>DOM manipulation directives (e.g ng-if, ng-switch) and style attributes are not supported on the table sections, rows and cell elements. You are free to customize the contents of the cells in any way you want.</li>
                                <li>You can't use the `data-` notation for the attributes.</li>
                                <li>Custom start/end symbols, set up via the `$interpolate` service, are not supported.</li>
                                <li>The default global configuration is not done through a provider, but through a global object. Global templates can be provided though via the template cache mechanism.</li>
                            </ul>
                            These are some of the key complaints people have brought to my attention and I'm trying hard to address them in the next major release.
