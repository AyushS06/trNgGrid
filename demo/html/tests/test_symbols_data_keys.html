                        This is a test for checking whether the items and the header titles are being properly displayed even when the field names contain special characters.

                    <p class="text-warning">
                        Please bear in mind that Angular doesn't handle well data items with fields having '$' as the first character in their name.
                        As a side effect of this limitation, you'll find that for example column filtering won't work for such fields.
