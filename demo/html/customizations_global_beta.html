                When you've configured your own app, you have the option of tweaking the default look and feel of all the trNgGrid instances.
            </p>
            <div ng-controller="TrNgGridDemo.TestController" ng-init="generateItems(100)">
                <table tr-ng-grid items="myItems" page-items="5" order-by="'id'"></table>
            </div>
            <p>
                Almost all the templates and the CSS classes, together with other global options, can be configured at start time.
                You can customize these the moment you configure your app:
            </p>
            <pre project-markup-from-state-view="source">
            </pre>
            <p>
                You can find all the templates in <em>beta/src/js/trNgGridConfiguration.ts</em>.
                Find your inspiration there when you wish to override the default look and feel of the grid.
            </p>
            <h4 class="text-warning">
                As you'll be marrying your templates with the inner guts of the component,
                you'll have to check and adjust your custom templates whenever you upgrade.
