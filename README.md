#### DEMO
You're currently viewing the DEMO branch. It contains resources used by the demo website. It's also used as a development environment, bringing together as GIT submodules all the other branches. There are individual Visual Studio projects, but keep in mind that the demo resources are common. `Web Essentials` and `Typescript` are the two extensions to VS that are being used.
